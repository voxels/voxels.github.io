I connected Unreal Engine to a Raspberry Pi via some C++ support classes that implemented a custom buffer carrying data from a scene capture component's texture memory across an MQTT broker to a wireless subscriber driving the LED Panels with a custom C++ driver.  At 128 x 64 pixels with 8 bit color depth, the connection across a local router exceeds 90 Hz.
