I am the lead UXE for iOS development on my team in Geo providing design solutions and production data-backed proofs of concept built on iOS for review by cross-functional collaborators, mission directors, and executive sponsors.  I collaborate with UXD partners to architect, author, maintain, and distribute a monolithic prototype demonstrating ~35 separate end to end user journeys framed for 1-2 year timelines following PM and Eng OKRs and 3-5 year projections of UX and PM strategies.  I manage the scope and schedule for delivering prototypes to partners by spending no more than 2 weeks on a single feature and finishing most incremental design asks within 1-2 days.  I work with L6-L7 designers and project managers to conceptualize and implement user journeys that will attract executive-level sponsorship. Notable tasks include:

- Documenting and pitching new concepts to executives to acquire sponsorship for short term design directions and long term R&D research investigations
- Blending Google Maps, StreetView, Live View, Immersive View, Earth Engine, ARKit, AVFoundation, MLKit, Firebase and other supporting frameworks into demonstrations of new capabilities in Maps across device ecosystems
- Investigating mixed media experiences including combinations of Unreal, ARKit, SceneKit, UIKit and SpriteKit with large language model (LaMDA) and Google Assistant generated summaries
Demonstrating alternative choices for the design consensus around the IA of Google Maps entry points 
- Embedding on a team to do a a multi-quarter deep dive into the place sheet framework
- Connecting iOS prototypes to a development cluster streaming Unreal Engine driven content and designing Unreal and Earth Engine camera paths and controller interactions to evaluate design proposals
- Connecting iOS apps to serial interfaces such as embedded IMUs and using the tracking sensors of AirPods to drive gestural interfaces
- Performing tests of photogrammetry, facial tracking, and skeleton tracking using iPhone and iPad depth cameras
- Developing an Apple Watch proof of concept and designing iMessage extensions
- Translating the Google Vector Tile API into a SceneKit demo that shows searching in 3D
- Authoring and documenting a personalization engine built on MLKit that relies on PII signals validated by internal users
- Developing and distributing to dogfood from google3 using production CI servers
- Configuring authorization servers and authoring Javascript endpoints and Swift model objects to connect iOS prototypes to production and development services and storage using URLSession and gRPC
