I was the lead UXE for iOS development on my team in Geo providing design solutions and production data-backed proofs of concept built on iOS for review by cross-functional collaborators, mission directors, and executive sponsors.  I collaborated with UXD partners to architect, author, maintain, and distribute a monolithic prototype demonstrating ~35 separate end to end user journeys framed for 1-2 year timelines following PM and Eng OKRs and 3-5 year projections of UX and PM strategies.  I managed the scope and schedule for delivering prototypes to partners by spending no more than 2 weeks on a single feature and finishing most incremental design asks within 1-2 days.  I worked with L6-L7 designers and project managers to conceptualize and implement user journeys that will attract executive-level sponsorship. Notable tasks included:

- Led rapid prototyping eﬀorts to iterate and refine concepts quickly, ensuring innovative solutions for iOS
development on Google Maps.
- Collaborated with UXD partners to create a monolithic prototype demonstrating 35 end-to-end user journeys,
guiding PM and Eng OKRs 1-2 years ahead of development and launch.
- Developed and patented experience concepts that set the design direction and defined engineering OKRs for
engineering teams.
- Integrated custom implementations of Google Maps technologies with Unreal Engine, ARKit, AVFoundation, MLKit,
and Firebase into live-data proofs of concept.
