_Beautified was an on-demand client for making beauty service appointments in the New York and Los Angeles markets. The app was designed to extend the lifestyle brand of a well-known millennial celebrity. Women used Beautified to locate recommended shops for haircuts, blowouts, nails, massages, etc. and book a last-minute appointment on their phone. The vendors were suggested based on location and time through a feed. Beautified gained traction through marketing in publications such as Vanity Fair, Teen Vogue and Elle, but the founders came to a disagreement about management that resulted in mutual lawsuits and a shuttering of the business._

The development of Beautified included three product owners, two back-end Ruby developers, a native iOS developer, and a contracted product design consultancy. The native iOS developer and back-end developers worked closely to develop API integrations. Responsibilities included:

- Fully rewriting the client interface to implement the design created by the product consultant
- Writing collection view content in auto-layout
- Integrating the Kahuna push notification marketing service
- Integrating custom behavior tracking analytics events with mParticle
- Integrating a credit card transaction SDKs
- Producing a data explorer of the purchase funnel events to evaluate the user flow design
- Presenting an analysis of the purchase flow visualization to the co-founders
