_MTV News was an iPhone and iPad application designed to wrap the content of www.mtv.com/news with a native navigation container and a single social feature. The client intercepted the inbound web content and modified the source code in transit to support a native navigation experience using the GoNative SDK. The user was encouraged to take screenshots of the content and share it with friends through many social network APIs. The client hired Crush & Lovely (http://crushlovely.com) to implement the design and Crush needed a subcontractor to develop the iOS client. The MTV team knew at the outset that their chosen solution was a temporary fix to a larger branding challenge, and the MTV News app was removed from the App Store in late 2017._

The development of MTV News was conducted by an internal project manager, external project manager, iOS developer, Android developer, and a backend web client team. The team followed an agile development process. Responsibilities included:
- Customizing the GoNative wrapper for MTV's web content
- Adding an interface to screenshot the content; adding the social network sharing APIs for iMessage Email,
Instagram, Facebook, Twitter, Pinterest, and WhatsApp
- Delivering pixel-perfect animation sequences for UI component transitions
