_Homer Learning is a cross-platform application designed to teach elementary reading to toddlers between the ages of 2 and 8. Homer uses stories, songs, and mini games to gradually present letters and words. Simple personalization is used to engage a child's interest. Homer retains more than 250,000 subscription-based monthly active parent and teacher users._

At Homer, a team of as large as seven iOS engineers collaborated on the iPhone and iPad client for Homer Learning, four engineers provided backend engineering, and three engineers produced the content pipeline. Covering code with unit tests and integration tests, using XCTest, OCMock, and mocha.js was mandatory. Development shifted over the course of the year from a trunk-based process to a peer reviewed, git-flow process driven by occasional pair-programming, daily remote, agile standups, and project retrospectives recorded in JIRA and Google Docs. Deliverables included:

- Contributed code and white papers to the iOS, analytics, backend, and content production pipeline teams
- Evaluating content production pipeline alternatives for producing cross-platform character animation
- Reviewing GraphQL implementation and proposing a refactoring strategy to support the long-term roadmap
- Adding Parse API endpoints covered by mocha.js tests
- Design and implementation of a dynamic, CMS-driven contextual onboarding system
- Design and implementation of behavior tracking and non-fatal error reporting to multiple service providers
- Refactoring the main navigation controller to provide smooth transition blends for UIKit and Cocos2D
- Refactoring audio asset handling into a sequenced, multi-track audio manager
- Collaborating with a senior web engineer to implement OAuth for partner subscribers
- Code reviewing legacy modules and presenting findings for planning with executives and managers
- Configuring continuous integration for XCode bots and parallelized tests for Bitrise
- Converting the XCode project and unit tests to support Swift frameworks in Cocoapods
- Developing new mini game templates and view controllers
- Building a proof of concept for a state machine that improves orientation and handles deep links to any page
